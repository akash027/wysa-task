Deploying on Heroku:
1. Create a Heroku Account:
If you don't have a Heroku account, sign up at Heroku.

2. Install Heroku CLI:
Download and install the Heroku Command Line Interface (CLI) from here.

3. Login to Heroku:
Open a terminal and run heroku login to log in to your Heroku account.

4. Prepare Your App:
Organize your project with necessary files including app.py, clf.pkl, tfidf.pkl, and index.html.

5. Create a requirements.txt File:
List all the dependencies required by your app. You can create this file by running pip freeze > requirements.txt.

6. Initialize a Git Repository:
If your project is not already a Git repository, run the following commands:

bash
Copy code
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
7. Create a Procfile:
Create a file named Procfile (without any file extension) in your project's root directory. Add the following line:

makefile
Copy code
web: gunicorn app:app
This tells Heroku to use Gunicorn as the web server for your Flask app.

8. Deploy to Heroku:
Run the following commands to deploy your app:

bash
Copy code
heroku create your-app-name
git push heroku master
heroku open
This will create a new Heroku app, deploy your code, and open it in your default web browser.

Important Notes:
Ensure your machine learning model and dependencies are compatible with the environment you choose.

Modify your Flask app to load the pickled model (clf.pkl and tfidf.pkl) from the correct path.

Secure any sensitive information or API keys. Use environment variables for configuration.

Consider setting up a custom domain for your Heroku app if needed.
